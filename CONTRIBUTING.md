# Contribution Guidelines

To submit a PR for a library, it must have at least 20 stars. If the last commit was more than one year ago, it should be marked as inactive. 

Add it to the `README.md` and the `docs/data.js`. Note that "dependencies" does not mean every dependency, but just the core library(s) it was built on.

For libraries, match the format of `[Library](url) - description from the actual github repo. <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/[REPO]?style=social" align="center">`
