# Contribution Guidelines

To submit a PR for a library, it must have at least 20 stars (if it has less than 20 but more than 5, it should go in the "Up and Coming" section). If the last commit was more than one year ago, it should be marked as inactive. 

Add it to the `README.md` and, if you want to be in the web interface, in the `docs/data.js`. Note that "dependencies" does not mean every dependency, but just the core library(s) it was built on.

For libraries, match the format of `[Library](url) - description from the actual github repo. <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/[REPO]?style=social" align="center">`
